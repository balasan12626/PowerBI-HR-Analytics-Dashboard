## 📌 Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze employee attrition within an organization. By leveraging the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset**, we identify key factors contributing to employee turnover, allowing HR departments to take data-driven actions to improve retention and employee satisfaction.

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of attrition rates, demographic breakdowns, and satisfying scores, deep-diving into job roles, income levels, and work-life balance correlations.

## 🚀 Key Features & Insights

-   **Attrition Overview**: Visualizes the overall attrition rate and headcount status.
-   **Demographic Analysis**: Breakdowns by Age, Gender, and Marital Status to identify high-risk groups.
-   **Job Role Insights**: Analysis of attrition across different departments (Sales, R&D, HR) and specific job roles.
-   **Satisfaction Metrics**: Correlation between Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, and Attrition.
-   **Income & Tenure**: Exploring how Monthly Income and Years at Company impact the likelihood of leaving.
-   **Interactive Filtering**: Slice and dice the data by Department, Education Field, and more for granular insights.
